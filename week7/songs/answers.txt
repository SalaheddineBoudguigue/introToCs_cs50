We can calculate the average of each feature with

SELECT Avg(energy), Avg(valence), Avg(danceability)
FROM songs;

Then we calculate the average of three given averages to
have a number that will define someone's Aura.

This method can give bad estimations about someone's aura,
since it considers the three features (energy,valence,danceability)
to be equally likely in terms of importance, while a listener can
tends to prefer high enegetic musics, or musics with low danceability.
So as a solution to this, we should first figure out what the listener in into,
by sorting the musics he listens to in terms of each feature.
Then we can introduce a weight on features, so we privilege some, and we
reduce some, so when calculating the average, we can have a more precise
number to classify someone's Aura.
Of course, there might other better solutions.
