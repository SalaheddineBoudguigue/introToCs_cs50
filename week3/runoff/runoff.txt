In runoff, we will use ranking to select the winner

Here is how it works :

  while true :
    1.increment every candidate's vote with one for every time he is ranked first
    2.if a candidate has more than 50% (strict) of votes, he wins -> BREAK
    3. else :
      4.if possible : eliminate the ones with the fewest number of votes and redo 1.
      5.else : return that the vote is tied between remaining candidates
